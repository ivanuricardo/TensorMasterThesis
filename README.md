# TensorMasterThesis

This repo is in support to the masters thesis "Tensor Methods in Econometrics" by Ivan Ricardo.
Here, we discuss multiple tensor methods that have come up in the literature for the analysis of
the Global VAR data set. The preprocessed data set can be found in the R package "TensorEconometrics".
Additionally, we use other packages for our analysis such as rTensor, Tensor, TensorTS, and 
MultiwayRegression.
